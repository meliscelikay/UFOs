# UFOs

## Overview of Project:

 The main purpose of this project is to create a website to search for UFO sightings details and data. The site will have multiple search fields such as country, state, city, date, and UFO shapes. User will be able to use multiple search fields to narrow down the data they are looking for.

All criteria can be entered simultaneously or in different configurations such as two or three at a time as needed.

## Summary
- There are multiple issues with the search fields which would make it user unfriendly and inefficient. One of the main problems is the case sensitive nature of the search, user must enter lower case letter in order to execute the search. Another issue is the lack of drop-down menu option such as for city or state, which complicates the search unnecessarily. Also, there is not button to search, users must hit “enter” on their keyboard in order to execute the search which could create some confusion. Lastly, there is no “refresh” or “clear” button to launch a new search. 

- Overall, this is an interesting website with many detailed search fields, but functionality and user experience could use some improvements. Extraterrestrial and Unidentified Flying Objects have been popular topics for many decades and has gained more popularity in the last few years due to more detailed US government reports and investigations… “E.T. Home!”
